# Vow

Custom promise implementation inspired by [Nicholas C. Zakas](https://humanwhocodes.com) project called [Pledge](https://github.com/humanwhocodes/pledge) that implements JavaScript promises that matches the ECMA-262 specification as closely as possible.

## Description

I really like the approach of Nicholas about study and how to understand something.

>Early on in my career, I learned a lot by trying to recreate functionality I saw on websites. I found it helpful to investigate why something worked the way that it worked, and that lesson has stuck with me for decades. The best way to know if you really understand something is to take it apart and put it back together again. Thatâ€™s why, when I decided to deepen my understanding of promises, I started thinking about creating promises from scratch.
> -- Nicholas C. Zakas

And inspired by this I'm doing the same, writing my own implementation of promises to dig into the internal of promises.

**Note:** This package is intended only for educational purposes and should not be used in production. There's no reason to use this package because the JavaScript `Promise` class already implements all of this functionality.
